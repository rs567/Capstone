# Toolbox
Small bits of code for engineering problems that make life easier

>CircleSpline: Code used to makes a Ushaped tube (2D, IcoFoam)
    >SplineGen.py: Takes equation and generates points (3D)
    >Vertex.py: Generates C++ format points from list of x,y,z values
    >zeroIndex.py: Takes space seperated numbers and subtracts one. To fix indexing errors
>Resistor
    >resistorSizer.py: Sizes combination of resistors (user defined) to match desired voltage/current output.
